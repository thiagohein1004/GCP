Congratulations Cloud Gurus,
you've reached another milestone,
By now you've had a chance
to take a look at a number
of the core managed services.
And you've also seen how
we can use the Command-line and G Cloud
to clearly specify what we want to have happen.
We've seen how data flows around
when we use different services.
And altogether, this makes up a powerful platform
that we can use to build things.
So what do I mean by building?
Well, building is about using tools
to create systems that get results.
And if you let me get just a little bit philosophical here,
I think that all forms of Cloud Architecture
are a kind of programming.
You're programming the cloud system.
You start by making a plan for how it should work.
And then you implement that plan as a set of resources
in connections, where you can configure them
and script them
and maybe deploy applications to them too.
And then those things come together to create that system
that gets you the results you want.
So looking ahead, we're gonna have
you take some ownership of this.
Instead of just watching data flows happen,
you're going to start wielding them like a skilled master.
Instead of doing all the things yourself,
you're going to be causing
the things that you want to happen.
So you're going to start building on
this foundation of understanding
how the Google Cloud works.
If you have any questions, let me know.
If not, let's jump into the next lecture.
I'll see you there.
